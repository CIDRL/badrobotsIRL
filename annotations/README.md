## BAD Robots IRL

When analyzing the human reactions to robot failures, a codebook was created to classify verbal and nonverbal reactions, and a statistical analysis was conducted to learn more about the relationship between facial, audio, and body pose features and the robot's successive error. More details elaborating on the codebook and statistical analysis can be found in [supplemental material](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/HRI25_LBR_BadRobotsIRL_supp.pdf) or below.

### Codebook

The codebook for analyzing the video dataset of interactions between the participant and the robot named HelperBot during the HelperBot's successive errors is found on page 2 of [supplemental material](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/HRI25_LBR_BadRobotsIRL_supp.pdf).

The code used to plot annotations is found at [plot.ipynb](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/plot.ipynb).

The data used to plot the annotations is found in the [data subdirectory](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/tree/main/annotations/data).

The plots created are found in the [plots subdirectory](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/tree/main/annotations/plots).

### Statistical Analysis

A statistical analysis of the video dataset of interactions between the participant and the robot named HelperBot during the HelperBot's successive errors is found on page 3 of [supplemental material](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/HRI25_LBR_BadRobotsIRL_supp.pdf).

The code used for the analysis is found at [full_statsanalysis.ipynb](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/preprocessing/stats/full_statsanalysis.ipynb).
