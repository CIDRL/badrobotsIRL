## BAD Robots IRL

### Codebook

The codebook for analyzing the video dataset of interactions between the participant and the robot during the robot's successive errors is found on page 2 of [supplemental material](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/HRI25_LBR_BadRobotsIRL_supp.pdf)

The code used to plot annotations is found at [plot.ipynb](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/plot.ipynb).

The data used to plot the annotations is found in the [data subdirectory](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/tree/main/annotations/data)

The plots created are found in the [plots subdirectory](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/tree/main/annotations/plots)

### Statistical Analysis

A statistical analysis of the video dataset of interactions between the participant and the robot during the robot's successive errors is found on page 3 of [supplemental material](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/HRI25_LBR_BadRobotsIRL_supp.pdf)

The code used is found at [full_statsanalysis.ipynb](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/preprocessing/stats/full_statsanalysis.ipynb).
