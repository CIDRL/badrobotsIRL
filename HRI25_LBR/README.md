## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for a study exploring human responses to successive conversational errors made by robots.

Our study investigates these responses through a user study involving 26 participants, where we examine the behavioral and emotional shifts that occur when users interact with a robot named HelperBot that was wizarded to make successive conversational errors.

When analyzing the human reactions to robot failures, a codebook was created to classify verbal and nonverbal reactions, and a statistical analysis was conducted to learn more about the relationship between facial, audio, and body pose features and HelperBot's successive error. More details elaborating on the codebook and statistical analysis can be found in [supplemental material](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/HRI25_LBR_BadRobotsIRL_supp.pdf) or below.

This work contributes valuable insights into improving human-robot communication, particularly in scenarios where robots make repeated errors, and has potential applications for building more resilient and adaptive robotic systems.

### Codebook

The codebook for analyzing the video dataset of interactions between the participant and HelperBot during HelperBot's successive errors is found on page 2 of [supplemental material](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/HRI25_LBR_BadRobotsIRL_supp.pdf).

The code used to plot annotations is found at [plot.ipynb](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/plot.ipynb).

The data used to plot the annotations is found in the [data subdirectory](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/tree/main/annotations/data).

The plots created are found in the [plots subdirectory](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/tree/main/annotations/plots).

### Statistical Analysis

A statistical analysis of the video dataset of interactions between the participant and HelperBot during HelperBot's successive errors is found on page 3 of [supplemental material](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/annotations/HRI25_LBR_BadRobotsIRL_supp.pdf).

The code used for the analysis is found at [full_statsanalysis.ipynb](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/badrobotsIRL/blob/main/preprocessing/stats/full_statsanalysis.ipynb).
